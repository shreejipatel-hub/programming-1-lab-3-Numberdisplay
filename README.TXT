instance and leave the inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as increment and setValue.






8) when I created the machine I used the call increment once so that my value was 1 and then when I set the value to 3 it had changed to 3 like it should
    but when I set the value to 10 and then tried to call getValue the value stayed the same it stayed 3 even tho the terminal showed the value had chnaged.
    so no it did not result in the change of the stored value.
