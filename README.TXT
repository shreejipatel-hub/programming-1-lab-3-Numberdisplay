Project: number-display
Authors: Michael Kölling and David J. Barnes

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class NumberDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as increment and setValue.






8) when I created the machine I used the call increment once so that my value was 1 and then when I set the value to 3 it had changed to 3 like it should
    but when I set the value to 10 and then tried to call getValue the value stayed the same it stayed 3 even tho the terminal showed the value had chnaged.
    so no it did not result in the change of the stored value.
9)when I call the methode getValue after creating a new machine with a roll over limit of 10 and then set the value to 10 the result will be 0 because
    when the limit is reached it roll overs to 0.
12)well since we since the condition from"<" to"<=" now it will show you the limit since the value 
    can be smaller or equal to the limit noe for example now the machine will be able to display to according to number 9.
13)the only parameter value that would no longer exist is 0 because now it will accept value only greater than 0 and smaller than limit.
14)now that the condition uses ||(OR) so that it will be able to for example accept any negative number lets say -5 for example 
    becuase of the seconde condition that states replacementvalue<0 which means it wont be able to pass 1st condition but will will be able to pass this
    one since -5 is smaller compared to the limit.
